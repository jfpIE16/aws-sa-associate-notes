# AWS Fundamentals
## Public vs Private Services
Is related from a network perspective.
### AWS Private Zone
**VPCs** are isolated unless configured otherwise.
### AWS Public Zone
This is where AWS public services operate from.  
* On-premises can access VPCs only if configured via VPN or Direct Connect.
* Access to AWS public via IGW.
* Private services can be fiven a public IP - 1:1 translated by the IGW.
* Access to internet via IGW.

## AWS Global Architecture
### Region
Is an area of the world that AWS selected and inside this region is a full deployment of AWS architecture (Full compute, storage, DB, AI, etc.). Regions are geographically spread.  
Benefits:
* Geographic separation - isolated fault domain
* Geopolitical separation - Different governance
* Location control - Performance

#### Availability zones
Isolated infrastructure inside a region. Connected with high speed redundant network.

### Edge locations
Are smaller than regions and generally they only have content distribution services as well some types of edge computing. Low latency and high speed distribution.


### Service Resilience
* Globally Resilient -> IAM, Route53
* Region Resilient -> VPC
* AZ Resilient


## Virtual private cloud (VPC) Basics
A virtual network inside AWS and is within 1 account & 1 region. Is private and isolated unless you decide otherwise.
1. Default VPC is created once per region when an AWS account is first created.
   1. One per region - can be removed & recreated.
   2. Default VPC CIDR is always 172.31.0.0/16
   3. /20 Subnet in each AZ in the region
   4. Internet Gateway (IGW), Security Group (SG) & NACL
   5. Subnets assign public IPv4 addresses
2. Custom VPCs.

## Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics
Provide access to virtual machines known as instances. Compute power. Infrastructure as a service, your unite of consumption is the instance.
* IAAS - Provides virtual machines
* Private service by-default - uses VPC networking
* AZ Resilient - Instance fails if AZ fails
* Different instance sizes and capabilities
* On-Demand billing - Per second
* Local on-host storage or Elastic Block Store (EBS)

### Instance Lifecycle
* Running / Is billed all time.
* Stopped / Charges only for storage.
* Terminated &rarr; Irreversible action / No charges since you delete disks.

### Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a supported and maintained image provided by AWS that provides the information required to launch an instance. You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you require multiple instances with the same configuration. You can use different AMIs to launch instances when you require instances with different configurations.

### Connection to EC2
1. Windows &rarr; RDP protocol
2. Linux &rarr; SSH using a key-pair.

## Simple Storage Service (S3)
Is a core AWS service. Default storage service in AWS.
* Global Storage Platform - regional based/resilient.
* Public service, unlimited data & multi-user
* ... Movies, Audio, Photos, Text, Large Data sets
* Economical & accessed via UI/CLI/API/HTTP

### Objects
Conceptually an object is associated to a file.
* Key &rarr; file name.
* Value &rarr; content being stored. Zero bytes ... 5TB.
* Version ID
* Metadata
* Access Contro
* Subresources

### Buckets
A bucket is created in an specific region. The bucket name needs to be globally unique across all regions and accounts. Everything is stored at a root level it doesn't work as a filesystem.

### S3 Patterns and Anti-patterns
* S3 is an object store - not file or block
* You canÂ´t mount an S3 bucket.
* Great for large scale data storage, distribution or upload
* Great for offload
* INPUT and/or OUTPUT to many AWS products
