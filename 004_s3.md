# Simple Storage Service
## S3 Security (Resource Policies & ACLs)
### S3 Bucket Policies
* A form of resource policy
* Like identity policies, but attached to a bucket
* Resource perspective permissions
* ALLOW/DENY same or different accounts
* ALLOW/DENY Anonymous principals

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)
* ACLs on objects and bucket
* A Subresource
* Legacy
* Inflexible & Simple permissions

So much security ... help
* Identity: Controlling different resources
* Identity: You have a preference for IAM
* Identity: Same account
* Resource - Bucket: Just controlling S3
* Resource - Bucket: Anonymous or Cross-Account
* ACLs: NEVER - unless you must

## S3 Static Hosting
Static Website Hosting is a feature of the product which lets you define a HTTP endpoint, set index and error documents and use S3 like a website.
* Normal access is via AWS APIs
* This feature allows access via HTTP - e.g Blogs..
* Index and Error documents are set
* Website Endpoint is created
* Custom Domain via Route 53 - Bucketname matters
