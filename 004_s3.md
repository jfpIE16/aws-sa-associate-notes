## S3 Security (Resource Policies & ACLs)
### S3 Bucket Policies
* A form of resource policy
* Like identity policies, but attached to a bucket
* Resource perspective permissions
* ALLOW/DENY same or different accounts
* ALLOW/DENY Anonymous principals

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)
* ACLs on objects and bucket
* A Subresource
* Legacy
* Inflexible & Simple permissions

So much security ... help
* Identity: Controlling different resources
* Identity: You have a preference for IAM
* Identity: Same account
* Resource - Bucket: Just controlling S3
* Resource - Bucket: Anonymous or Cross-Account
* ACLs: NEVER - unless you must

## S3 Static Hosting
Static Website Hosting is a feature of the product which lets you define a HTTP endpoint, set index and error documents and use S3 like a website.
* Normal access is via AWS APIs
* This feature allows access via HTTP - e.g Blogs..
* Index and Error documents are set
* Website Endpoint is created
* Custom Domain via Route 53 - Bucketname matters

## Object versioning and MFA Delete
Object versioning is a feature which can be enabled on an S3 bucket - allowing the bucket to store multi versions of objects

It starts off in a disable state and when enabled it can´t be disable never again instead it can be suspended.

Versioning lets you store multiple versions of objects within a bucket. Operations which would modify objects generate a new version with a different id.

When deleting something versioned then a delete marker is created for that object and is hidden.

* ... cannot be switched off - only suspended
* Space is consumed by all versions

MFA Delete is a feature that when is enabled is going to request a token to delete versions of an object.

## S3 performance optimization
Single PUT Upload
* Single data stream to S3
* Stream fails - upload fails
* Requires full restart
* Speed & reliability = limit of 1 stream
* Any upload up to 5GB

Multipart Upload
* Data is broken up
* Minimum data size is 100MB for multipart
* 10,000 max parts, 5MB -> 5GB
* Last part can be smaller than 5MB
* Parts can fail, and be restarted
* Transfer rate = speeds of all parts

S3 Accelerated Transfer (Off)  
Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration is designed to optimize transfer speeds from across the world into S3 buckets. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of the globally distributed edge locations in Amazon CloudFront. As the data arrives at an edge location, the data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

## S3 Object Encryption
Buckets aren´t encrypted, objects are.
**Client-side encryption **is the act of encrypting your data locally to help ensure its security in transit and at rest. To encrypt your objects before you send them to Amazon S3, use the Amazon S3 Encryption Client. When your objects are encrypted in this manner, your objects aren't exposed to any third party, including AWS. Amazon S3 receives your objects already encrypted; Amazon S3 does not play a role in encrypting or decrypting your objects. You can use both the Amazon S3 Encryption Client and server-side encryption to encrypt your data. When you send encrypted objects to Amazon S3, Amazon S3 doesn't recognize the objects as being encrypted, it only detects typical objects.

**Server-side encryption **is the encryption of data at its destination by the application or service that receives it. Amazon S3 encrypts your data at the object level as it writes it to disks in AWS data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. As long as you authenticate your request and you have access permissions, there is no difference in the way you access encrypted or unencrypted objects. For example, if you share your objects by using a presigned URL, that URL works the same way for both encrypted and unencrypted objects. Additionally, when you list objects in your bucket, the list API operations return a list of all objects, regardless of whether they are encrypted.

By using server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (**SSE-C**), you can store your own encryption keys. With the encryption key that you provide as part of your request, Amazon S3 manages data encryption as it writes to disks and data decryption when you access your objects. Therefore, you don't need to maintain any code to perform data encryption and decryption. The only thing that you need to do is manage the encryption keys that you provide.

All new object uploads to Amazon S3 buckets are encrypted by default with server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (**SSE-S3**).

Server-side encryption protects data at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a key that it rotates regularly. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) to encrypt all uploaded objects.

Unless you specify otherwise, buckets use SSE-S3 by default to encrypt objects. However, you can choose to configure buckets to use server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (**SSE-KMS**) instead. For more information, see Specifying server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS).

## S3 Bucket Keys
Amazon S3 Bucket Keys reduce the cost of Amazon S3 server-side encryption using AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS). Bucket-level keys for SSE can reduce AWS KMS request costs by up to 99 percent by decreasing the request traffic from Amazon S3 to AWS KMS.
